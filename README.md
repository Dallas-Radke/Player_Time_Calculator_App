<h1 align = "center">Player Time Calculator App</h1>

#### This stores the R Shiny script that runs an application for calculating the equal amount of playing time for each player on your team.  

This application calculates the following:
- `Total Player Time` - the total amount of time played by the player for equal playing time amonst all players on the team
- `Player Substitution Time` - the amount of time before the player should be substituted in the game
- `Substitution Schedule` - this table displays the # of times a player should be substitueted and allows you to set player lineups.  This can then be updated with your own player names using the "Add Player Names" button and text input.
